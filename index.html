                        <p> <em> Electornic Engineer, failed Startupper and wannabe World traveller </strong> </em></p>
                        <p>I was born in Rome in 1988, I grew up in Italy and France, and after my university studies I moved to London.
                            My satisfaction in solving problems pushed me towards studing engineering, although the choice of discipline was quite random. 
                            I eventually got passionate about designing digital systems, mostly in the consumer product area.
                            After several years of working in the field, I decided to take some time to explore other aspects of life.
                            Since 2019, I am nomad and have been travelling around the Globe, still not certain of what my life will be tomorrow!
                            I embrace a mindful way of living, I like Adlerian psycology and I'm in love with rock climbing.
                        </p>
